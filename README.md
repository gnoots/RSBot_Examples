Example scripts for RSBot/Powerbot.
==============

Download the repository from https://github.com/gnoots/RSBot_Examples/archive/master.zip and open javadocs/index.html to view the javadocs. These provide a clearer picture of the classes and the methods they use.

If a script seems to be missing an explanation for something important, check the other scripts.


    What's covered in each script:

        • Fighter: Basic interaction, nodes, combat, looting, banking, walking.
        • Miner: SceneObject interaction, simple paint drawing, dropping items.
        • Smithing: Widget interaction, enums, dynamic sleeps, bank withdrawing, MessageListener.
        • Firemaker: Paint GUI, MouseListener.
        • Alchemy: Ability/hotkey use, time till level & exp/hr, getting item prices, MessageListener regex.
        • Fisher: More paint drawing, mouse trails.


Note: none of these scripts are intended to be flawless. While the scripts should work without much trouble, any quirks are left for you to iron out.
