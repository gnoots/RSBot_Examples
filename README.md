Example scripts for RSBot/Powerbot.
==============

Download the repository from https://github.com/gnoots/RSBot_Examples/archive/master.zip and open javadocs/index.html to view the javadocs. These provide a clearer picture of the classes and the methods they use.

If a script seems to be missing an explanation for something important, check the other scripts.

    What's covered in each script:

        • Fighter: Basic interaction, combat, looting, banking, walking.
        • Miner: SceneObject interaction, simple paint drawing, dropping items.
        • Smithing: Widget interaction, Enums, Dynamic sleeps, bank withdrawing, MessageListener.
	• Firemaker: Paint GUI, MouseListener.

Note: none of these scripts are intended to be flawless. While the scripts should work without much trouble, any quirks are left for you to iron out.
